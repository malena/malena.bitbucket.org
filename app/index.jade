					h2.subtitle Front End Web Developer
					.description
						p I've been a Front End Web Developer for over 5 years and have tons of experience working in different environments, using different templating languages, integrating with several back end technologies such as Java, Python and Node.
						p I also understand and have set up projects from scratch using task managers such as Grunt to compile and minify my HTML, CSS and JS. Lately I've been looking more into webpack and npm scripts.
						p I'm a master at CSS and currently trying to master JavaScript. I have been spoiled by libraries like jQuery, or frameworks like Backbone and Angular, but I'd like to dive deeper into just plain old JavaScript.
						p For that reason I am currently learning React.js and would love to find an opportunity to work in an environment where I can master building UI components.

					h2 My roots as a web developer
					p I started off as a CSS cross browser magician, back when ie6 was the most used browser.
					p I spent most of my days making layouts look indentical in all browsers, but eventually as browsers updated and as there were more tools to help with this issue such as Modernizr, I started learning a bit of JavaScript.
					p Slowly I learned how lovely and fancy you can make something look with the power of JavaScript.
					p I quickly learned to be a pro at looking up jQuery methods, but didn't really have a good foundation for how to write JS.
					p I was then lucky to work on a team that introduced me to "best practices", read chapters from "The good parts" and with some mentorship started writting more robust JS.

					h2 Doing the things that make me smile 
					p Hiking, climbing, cycling, exploring the world; these are the sort of things that make me smile. 
					p Working on apps that make a difference, feeling challenged and striving to do more is what makes my daily life feel awesome.
					p These days I mostly find myself massaging my two cats, and keeping my leg up (literally).
					//p My dream is to live near mountains and to one day own an alpaca!
