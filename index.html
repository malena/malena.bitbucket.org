Lately I've been looking more into webpack and npm scripts.</p><p>I am quick at prototyping, using bootstrap or skeleton, and follow the SMACSS methodologies to organize CSS.</p><p>I am a master of CSS and currently mastering JavaScript. I have used a vast number of libraries like jQuery, or frameworks like Backbone and Angular, but I would like to strengthen writing pure JavaScript. </p><p>These days I’ve been diving into React.js and would love to find an opportunity to work in an environment where I can master building UI components. </p></div></header><img src="/public/dist/images/malena.png" width="771" height="921" class="img-malena"></div></div><div class="panel panel-2"><div class="panel-inner"><header><h2>My roots as a web developer</h2><p>My first web job I was simply styling CSS components within Joomla and populating content. </p><p>My second job was part of a software team where I was known as the CSS cross browser magician. Back then, ie6 was the most used browser. I moved up to create various layouts as per design specifications and manage the front end entirely, including doing research on user experience and monitoring video recorded usability tests.</p><p>Once I learned about the power of JavaScript, I slowly started writting my own scripts. I learned to use jQuery but developed a better programming foundation once I went back to school for a JavaScript course. </p><p>Eventually I worked on dev team that introduced me to “best practices”, and with some mentorship and encouragement I became a front end lead of several projects.</p></header><div class="projects"><div class="leaf fun"><span class="title span-pulse"><a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Experiments">Experiments</a></span><img src="/public/dist/images/leaf.png" width="50" height="44" class="img-pulse"></div><div class="leaf websites"><span class="title span-pulse"><a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Websites">Websites </a></span><img src="/public/dist/images/leaf.png" width="50" height="44" class="img-pulse"></div><div class="leaf apps"><span class="title span-pulse"><a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Apps">Apps </a></span><img src="/public/dist/images/leaf.png" width="50" height="44" class="img-pulse"></div><div class="leaf campaigns"><span class="title span-pulse"><a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Campaigns">Campaigns </a></span><img src="/public/dist/images/leaf.png" width="50" height="44" class="img-pulse"></div></div><div class="panel-2-tree"><img src="/public/dist/images/tree-full.png" width="642" height="907" class="tree-top"></div></div><div class="panel-2-grass"></div></div><div class="panel panel-3"><div class="panel-inner"><header><h2>Today, I'm still blooming </h2><p>I learned I love working on applications and creating style guides and building interfaces.
